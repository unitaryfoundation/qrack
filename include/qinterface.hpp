     *
     * All physical evolution of a quantum state should be "unitary," except
     * measurement. Measurement of a qubit "collapses" the quantum state into
     * either only permutation states consistent with a |0> state for the bit,
     * or else only permutation states consistent with a |1> state for the bit.
     * Measurement also effectively multiplies the overall quantum state vector
     * of the system by a random phase factor, equiprobable over all possible
     * phase angles.
     *
     * Effectively, when a bit measurement is emulated, Qrack calculates the
     * norm of all permutation state components, to find their respective
     * probabilities. The probabilities of all states in which the measured
     * bit is "0" can be summed to give the probability of the bit being "0,"
     * and separately the probabilities of all states in which the measured
     * bit is "1" can be summed to give the probability of the bit being "1."
     * To simulate measurement, a random float between 0 and 1 is compared to
     * the sum of the probability of all permutation states in which the bit
     * is equal to "1". Depending on whether the random float is higher or
     * lower than the probability, the qubit is determined to be either |0> or
     * |1>, (up to phase). If the bit is determined to be |1>, then all
     * permutation eigenstates in which the bit would be equal to |0> have
     * their probability set to zero, and vice versa if the bit is determined
     * to be |0>. Then, all remaining permutation states with nonzero
     * probability are linearly rescaled so that the total probability of all
     * permutation states is again "normalized" to exactly 100% or 1, (within
     * double precision rounding error). Physically, the act of measurement
     * should introduce an overall random phase factor on the state vector,
     * which is emulated by generating another constantly distributed random
     * float to select a phase angle between 0 and 2 * Pi.
     *
     * Measurement breaks unitary evolution of state. All quantum gates except
     * measurement should generally act as a unitary matrix on a permutation
     * state vector. (Note that Boolean comparison convenience methods in Qrack
     * such as "AND," "OR," and "XOR" employ the measurement operation in the
     * act of first clearing output bits before filling them with the result of
     * comparison, and these convenience methods therefore break unitary
     * evolution of state, but in a physically realistic way. Comparable
     * unitary operations would be performed with a combination of X and CCNOT
     * gates, also called "Toffoli" gates, but the output bits would have to be
     * assumed to be in a known fixed state, like all |0>, ahead of time to
     * produce unitary logical comparison operations.)

     * |input, values[input]>, with "values[input]" placed in the "outputStart"
     * register.
     *
     * While a QInterface represents an interacting set of qubit-based
     * registers, or a virtual quantum chip, the registers need to interact in
     * some way with (classical or quantum) RAM. SuperposeReg8 is a RAM access
     * method similar to the X addressing mode of the MOS 6502 chip, if the X
     * register can be in a state of coherent superposition when it loads from
     * RAM.
     *
     * The physical motivation for this addressing mode can be explained as
     * follows: say that we have a superconducting quantum interface device
     * (SQUID) based chip. SQUIDs have already been demonstrated passing
     * coherently superposed electrical currents. In a sufficiently
     * quantum-mechanically isolated qubit chip with a classical cache, with
     * both classical RAM and registers likely cryogenically isolated from the
     * environment, SQUIDs could (hopefully) pass coherently superposed
     * electrical currents into the classical RAM cache to load values into a
     * qubit register. The state loaded would be a superposition of the values
     * of all RAM to which coherently superposed electrical currents were
     * passed.
     *
     * In qubit system similar to the MOS 6502, say we have qubit-based
     * "accumulator" and "X index" registers, and say that we start with a
     * superposed X index register. In (classical) X addressing mode, the X
     * index register value acts an offset into RAM from a specified starting
     * address. The X addressing mode of a LoaD Accumulator (LDA) instruction,
     * by the physical mechanism described above, should load the accumulator
     * in quantum parallel with the values of every different address of RAM
     * pointed to in superposition by the X index register. The superposed
     * values in the accumulator are entangled with those in the X index
     * register, by way of whatever values the classical RAM pointed to by X
     * held at the time of the load. (If the RAM at index "36" held an unsigned
     * char value of "27," then the value "36" in the X index register becomes
     * entangled with the value "27" in the accumulator, and so on in quantum
     * parallel for all superposed values of the X index register, at once.) If
     * the X index register or accumulator are then measured, the two registers
     * will both always collapse into a random but valid key-value pair of X
     * index offset and value at that classical RAM address.
     *
     * Note that a "superposed store operation in classical RAM" is not
     * possible by analagous reasoning. Classical RAM would become entangled
     * with both the accumulator and the X register. When the state of the
     * registers was collapsed, we would find that only one "store" operation
     * to a single memory address had actually been carried out, consistent
     * with the address offset in the collapsed X register and the byte value
     * in the collapsed accumulator. It would not be possible by this model to
     * write in quantum parallel to more than one address of classical memory
     * at a time.
