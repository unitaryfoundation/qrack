/**
 * To define a Hamiltonian, give a vector of controlled single bit gates ("HamiltonianOp" instances) that are
 * applied by left-multiplication in low-to-high vector index order on the state vector.
 *
 * To specify Hamiltonians with interaction terms, arbitrary sets of control bits may be specified for each term, in
 * which case the term is acted only if the (superposable) control bits are true. The "antiCtrled" bool flips the
 * overall convention, such that the term is acted only if all control bits are false. Additionally, for a combination
 * of control bits and "anti-control" bits, an array of booleans, "ctrlToggles," of length "ctrlLen" may be specified
 * that flips the activation state for each control bit, (relative the global anti- on/off convention,) without altering
 * the state of the control bits.
 *
 * The point of this "toggle" behavior is to allow enumeration of arbitrary local Hamiltonian terms with permutations of
 * a set of control bits. For example, a Hamiltonian might represent an array of local electromagnetic potential wells.
 * If there are 4 wells, each with independent potentials, control "toggles" could be used on two control bits, to
 * enumerate all four permutations of two control bits with four different local Hamiltonian terms.
 *
 * \warning Hamiltonian components might not commute.
 *
 * As a general point of linear algebra, where A and B are linear operators, e^{i * (A + B) * t} = e^{i * A * t} *
 * e^{i * B * t} might NOT hold, if the operators A and B do not commute. As a rule of thumb, A will commute with B
 * at least in the case that A and B act on entirely different sets of qubits. However, for defining the intended
 * Hamiltonian, the programmer can be guaranteed that the exponential factors will be applied right-to-left, by left
 * multiplication, in the order e^(i * H_(N - 1) * t) * e^(i * H_(N - 2) * t) * ... e^(i * H_0 * t) * |psi>. (For
 * example, if A and B are single bit gates acting on the same bit, form their composition into one gate by the intended
 * right-to-left fusion and apply them as a single HamiltonianOp.)
