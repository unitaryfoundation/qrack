     * Set 8 bit register bits by a superposed index-offset-based read from
     * classical memory
     *
     * "inputStart" is the start index of 8 qubits that act as an index into
     * the 256 byte "values" array. The "outputStart" bits are first cleared,
     * then the separable |input, 00000000> permutation state is mapped to
     * |input, values[input]>, with "values[input]" placed in the "outputStart"
     * register. FOR BEST EFFICIENCY, the "values" array should be allocated aligned to a 64-byte boundary. (See the
     * unit tests suite code for an example of how to align the allocation.)
     *
     * While a QInterface represents an interacting set of qubit-based
     * registers, or a virtual quantum chip, the registers need to interact in
     * some way with (classical or quantum) RAM. IndexedLDA is a RAM access
     * method similar to the X addressing mode of the MOS 6502 chip, if the X
     * register can be in a state of coherent superposition when it loads from
     * RAM.
     *
     * The physical motivation for this addressing mode can be explained as
     * follows: say that we have a superconducting quantum interface device
     * (SQUID) based chip. SQUIDs have already been demonstrated passing
     * coherently superposed electrical currents. In a sufficiently
     * quantum-mechanically isolated qubit chip with a classical cache, with
     * both classical RAM and registers likely cryogenically isolated from the
     * environment, SQUIDs could (hopefully) pass coherently superposed
     * electrical currents into the classical RAM cache to load values into a
     * qubit register. The state loaded would be a superposition of the values
     * of all RAM to which coherently superposed electrical currents were
     * passed.
     *
     * In qubit system similar to the MOS 6502, say we have qubit-based
     * "accumulator" and "X index" registers, and say that we start with a
     * superposed X index register. In (classical) X addressing mode, the X
     * index register value acts an offset into RAM from a specified starting
     * address. The X addressing mode of a LoaD Accumulator (LDA) instruction,
     * by the physical mechanism described above, should load the accumulator
     * in quantum parallel with the values of every different address of RAM
     * pointed to in superposition by the X index register. The superposed
     * values in the accumulator are entangled with those in the X index
     * register, by way of whatever values the classical RAM pointed to by X
     * held at the time of the load. (If the RAM at index "36" held an unsigned
     * char value of "27," then the value "36" in the X index register becomes
     * entangled with the value "27" in the accumulator, and so on in quantum
     * parallel for all superposed values of the X index register, at once.) If
     * the X index register or accumulator are then measured, the two registers
     * will both always collapse into a random but valid key-value pair of X
     * index offset and value at that classical RAM address.
     *
     * Note that a "superposed store operation in classical RAM" is not
     * possible by analagous reasoning. Classical RAM would become entangled
     * with both the accumulator and the X register. When the state of the
     * registers was collapsed, we would find that only one "store" operation
     * to a single memory address had actually been carried out, consistent
     * with the address offset in the collapsed X register and the byte value
     * in the collapsed accumulator. It would not be possible by this model to
     * write in quantum parallel to more than one address of classical memory
     * at a time.
